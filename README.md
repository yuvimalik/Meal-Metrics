# metricsmeal

A flutter app to help dining halls track and optimize their food wastage. Built by 3 students during the M&T summer program in 4 days. 

##

Our app is connected centrally to a Firebase server that collects data from our backend model. This model is responsible for the physical product. It weighs the product, takes a photo and then 
identifies the food that has been wasted (could be multiple or more).
